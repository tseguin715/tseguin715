### Hi, I'm Trevor Seguin 👋

**Data Scientist | Ph.D. in Computational Chemistry**

I build hybrid AI systems that bridge the gap between unstructured data and production value. My work focuses on rigorous evaluation of LLM architectures and engineering features that drive measurable business outcomes.

### 🚀 Featured Public Projects

**[The RAG Complexity Paradox](https://tseguin715.github.io/rag-complexity-paradox/)**
*Benchmarking 96 RAG configurations to find the breaking points of agentic architectures.*
- **The Find:** Discovered an ~70% correctness ceiling across architectures, proving that "more agentic" often adds cost/latency without accuracy.
- **The Stack:** Python, LangChain, OpenAI/Local LLMs, Vector Search.
- [View Article](https://tseguin715.github.io/rag-complexity-paradox/) | [View Code](https://github.com/tseguin715/rag-complexity-paradox)

**[Profit-Optimized Purchasing Behavior](https://github.com/tseguin715/Online-Purchasing-Behavior)**
*Converting e-commerce churn predictions into a profit maximization engine.*
- **The Strategy:** Instead of standard accuracy metrics, I optimized decision thresholds against a custom cost/benefit matrix (accounting for inventory carrying costs vs. lost sales).
- **The Impact:** Achieved **12% higher profitability** than the baseline Random Forest model by tuning for financial outcomes rather than raw precision.
- **The Stack:** XGBoost, SHAP, Scikit-learn, Feature Engineering.

**[The X-Files: Data & Statistics](https://github.com/tseguin715/The-X-Files-Insights-from-Data)**
*A statistical deep-dive into TV ratings, metadata, and script analysis.*
- **The Analysis:** Applied **Mann-Whitney U-tests** and multivariate Gaussian smoothing (3D Surface Plots) to statistically rank seasons and quantify the "Mythology episode" premium.
- **The Stack:** Web Scraping, SciPy (Statistical Testing), Matplotlib/Seaborn, NLP.
