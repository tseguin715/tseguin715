### Hi, I'm Trevor Seguin 👋

**Data Scientist | Ph.D. in Computational Chemistry**

I build hybrid AI systems that bridge the gap between unstructured data and production value. My work focuses on rigorous evaluation of LLM architectures and engineering features that drive measurable business outcomes.

### 🚀 Featured Public Projects

**[The RAG Complexity Paradox](https://tseguin715.github.io/rag-complexity-paradox/)**
*Benchmarking 96 RAG configurations to find the breaking points of agentic architectures.*
- **The Find:** Discovered an ~70% correctness ceiling across architectures, proving that "more agentic" often adds cost/latency without accuracy.
- **The Stack:** Python, LangChain, OpenAI/Local LLMs, Vector Search.
